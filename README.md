A python simulator for a robotic smart warehouse, with many configurable properties.

Run python main.py -t to transmit positions to the visualiser.

Setting parameter slow_for_transit to true when calling run_simulation on a simulator object may be useful to reduce the speed of the simulator for visualisation.
